2,The Factory - Cafe With a Soul,""" 11/30/2016 1 check-in Listed in Brunch Spots I loved the eclectic and homey plush decor and who doesn't want to swing and drink their coffee?  I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but",to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make brunch so we headed out in search of chicken and waffles.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seat and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold brew coffee
3,The Factory - Cafe With a Soul,11/25/2016 Very cool decor! Good drinks Nice seating  However...  Just about everything is overpriced. $1.50 extra for 3 ounces of Almond Milk in a cortado. No WiFi Music is a bit loud and the mix is odd.  Pleasant French oldies followed by loud techno. Several tables were dirty when we got there. Service is average.  It feels like a Los Angeles coffee shot that is out of place.,2.0 star rating

9,The Factory - Cafe With a Soul,11/10/2016 3 check-ins This place has been shown on my social media for days so i finally visited! One of THE cutest and artistic looking coffeeshops I have ever visited. You can self order which is nice because you can take your time and look at the pictures to help you decide! I especially liked how pictures were shown so I knew which coffee/tea came out aesthetically  I ordered the famous matcha green latte and i dont usually drink coffee but it went beyond my expectations. They give you a good amount and its creamy and sweet. Only downside is no wifi.. So hard to study here.

I didn't want to tell anyone how awesome The Factory - Cafe With a Soul is because I don't want it overrun and super busy with no place to sit like so many other decent coffee shops in Austin. I happened to come in here with a friend mid-week and we sat here for several hours

21,The Factory - Cafe With a Soul,""" 10/10/2016 This place is so cute. New favorite coffee spot on Burnet/in Northcross. Almost wish I was still in grad school",so I would have an excuse to be there everyday.  Amazing coffee and best chicken & waffles ever! The chicken was seasoned perfectly and made for a delicious savory brunch (with the house made slaw they give you on the side). The olive oil cake was also awesome
22,The Factory - Cafe With a Soul,""" 10/25/2016 Tried this new cafe spot on Burnet with a friend - unassuming storefront",the decor is quaint af and you have to order from iPads at the counter and then choose a place to sit.  Not a brunch spot as we had thought

27,The Factory - Cafe With a Soul,""" 12/2/2016 What a fantastic atmosphere. I dropped in to catch up on some work and found a fantastic atmosphere and a great staff. I wish I could work here every day. I had the Darling pour-over and olive bread",and camped out near the pop-art fabric fire in the fireplace nook. Wallace (owner) and his team were spot-on with service and help. Full disclosure: The place is so beautiful on the inside that I Instagrammed it - couldn't help it

30,The Factory - Cafe With a Soul,""" 11/9/2016 Really cute and heavily hipster atmosphere. We tried this place late night on Saturday and enjoyed the first visit.

33,The Factory - Cafe With a Soul,""" 11/23/2016 1 check-in My best friend and I came to The Factory after seeing it on a couple of best new Austin brunch lists.

39,The Factory - Cafe With a Soul,""" 12/2/2016 A cafe that doesn't have Wifi but makes you order from an iPad. Seriously? $2 extra for almond milk?! The latte was already $5 for 12 oz.

58,The Factory - Cafe With a Soul,""" 11/20/2016 This is a tough one for me.  I took my children here as a treat one afternoon and our first impression was good.  I liked the decor and the place has swings and a chess set!  Score for the kids! I went to place my order and had to use an ipad.  It was DIY-ordering.  I hit the wrong button of course and ended up messing up my order and having to redo the whole thing.  Not too thrilled with the ipad idea but I moved on.  I sat down and when our drinks were ready","they called my name to go get them.  They had a tip jar on the counter.  I have an issue with this since I had to place my own order and then go get my own drink.  I'm not sure what they did extra that constitutes a tip?  The milk tea was delicious!  The kids loved their drinks and """"pop tarts.""""  I started glancing at some of the books laying on the table and the first one I picked up was on tattoos and had a few nude people inside.

67,The Marvelous Vintage Tea Party Co.,""" 11/19/2012 Sophie at Marvelous Vintage Tea Party Company was absolutely amazing to work with. She puts in a huge amount of time and effort into planning exactly what you want at a budget you are comfortable with. What I especially liked about this was the fact that she's willing to let customers handle certain aspects of the event if they'd like to make their budget smaller. For example",she suggested we purchase our own flowers at wholesale. She also has connections with a liquor merchant in Austin that allows you 15% off your alcohol purchases for the event--a fantastic deal! In terms of venue

The vibe is chill and relaxed and the decor is a lovely mix of industrial and shabby chic.  I normally get lattes here and they are hot",not too sweet and delicious. The americanos are also well done with no bitterness. Very consistent quality! My favorite food nom noms used to be the doughnuts (coffee and lavender are kick ass)
80,Vintage Heart Coffee,""" 6/4/2016 1 check-in Vintage Heart Coffee is by far the best coffeehouse to study/read/work in Austin. The shop has very vintage and cute Decors.

They make their own syrups so it's super delicious and blends well into the coffee rather than stick at the bottom like Starbucks. I got a vanilla latte and my BF got the lavender latte. Both were delicious! It was a good amount of sweet. I'm not a huge fan of lavender but I actually enjoyed it! It has a really nice fragrant taste and not too overpowering.

87,Vintage Heart Coffee,""" 7/4/2016 1 check-in Listed in ATX Coffee Fix Bucolic and quaint come to mind when visiting Vintage Heart. I like how there is plenty of natural light near the front.

There are some parking spots near the back but if you do snag a spot",be forewarned that it may be hard to get out if some customers end up choosing to park near the fence
88,Vintage Heart Coffee,9/23/2016 2 check-ins One of my favorite places to come and study! Its a bigger coffeshop than most and I really liked their tea and how they put everything in mason jars.

The background music is barely noticeable",there are ample electrical plugs throughout the coffee shop and it is comfortable.  I had 30 minutes to spare on the east side nearby Vintage Coffee and decided to cozy up with a cold brew and a Topo Chico. Service was friendly and I was happy with their selection of caffeine and variety of mineral waters. I haven't been drinking coffee for about 15 months so I was timid about going for the cold brew. The barista on duty shared that it is pretty mild and it is as blend a couple different coffees. I also opted for a Topo Chico. The cold brew was on the mild side and was served up in a mason jar. I found a comfortable couch and enjoyed my caffeinated beverage.  Tips: The wifi password is ilovepuppies

Not sure lol I also really like coming in the morning for some TacoDeli breakfast tacos (that is if I come before they run out).  This is definitely one of my new favorite study spots since I moved north. They have a good amount of big open tables and it seems like a lot of people come to just get work done. There are always rushes of people and groups just socializing but I still find it very easy to concentrate. There's just a magical balance of noise and music. I also really like the music they play which helps with my productivity.  The only thing I wish they did was stay open later. 8pm seems pretty early for a coffee shop but I guess I'm used to living near campus where more students need those late night coffee shops.

Now they say their coffee is organic..and personally I can't say I can taste a huge difference but I did love how the coffee came out.   They give it to you plain with the flavoring of your choice.

1279,CaffÃ© Medici,4/9/2016 I went here this morning with two of my daughters and my son-in-law for coffee and breakfast. We arrived at about 10 AM. They were down to their last three breakfast tacos. My daughter told me that they don't make the food there it is brought in from another vendor and they were simply very busy that morning and had sold out. We got the last of the tacos. So we also ordered some muffins and pastries. My taco was beans and pico de gallo. It was good but not as warm as I would like even though they heated up in the toaster oven. My blueberry muffin was dry and not very tasty. The coffee was good coffee. I just drink regular black coffee so I'm not into the exotics. The girls each had a chai latte which they thought was very good. My son-in-law have a cappuccino and he said that was good as well. All in all it was decent but not anything special. And of course being located in the Lemar union complex everything was a little pricey. It was a coffee shop. Not worth any extra time to travel there.

Organic pistashio- for pistashio lovers this is a must! Also if you don't like sweet things",this one is your pick.

I ordered their special of the day which was Mocha La'orange (mocha with an orange zest) and my friend got their Mayan hot chocolate (spices and cinnamon). I asked about how long the drinks would be so I know about what time to come back inside to grab them

Found Patika so I decided to give it a try. I was lucky enough to find a parking spot right in front of the shop. But there are plenty of street parking in the nearby neighborhood if you can't find a spot in their small parking lot. I wanted to try their latte and pastry (I know I shouldn't have but it was so tempting). Their pastry was made in house and the presentation was great. I had the hardest time deciding between pineapple morning cake and lemon raspberry white chocolate muffin. So I turned to the guy at the counter for his recommendation. He recommended the pineapple cake. I'm glad I listened to him because the pineapple cake was delicious!

The macaroni salad is what surprised me. Think potato salad instead of Mac and cheese. It had slices of apple and cucumber in there and was very refreshing. The actual potato salad was more like a mashed potato. My BF got a curry side and I really liked it. The sides were definitely on the lighter side which complimented the dish as a whole wonderfully. Oh and the rice...I don't usually care for rice but this rice had some kind of seasoning on it and it was bomb.  I got the iced saifa for coffee.

4399,Tea Haus,8/7/2016 1 check-in My friends and I were at the pho place next door and decided to walk over to Tea Haus for some boba for dessert after. I ordered the boba jasmine milk tea. The tapioca (honey boba) is very sweet (too sweet for me) and there was too much ice in the drink. I also had a slight problem with the service here. The guy who took my order barely spoke to me and seemed to be very out of it for whatever reason. It also took an unusually long amount of time for our orders to be ready.

Tea Haus is right next door to Phonatic(which is also great in their own right)but I was in the mood to try something I know I have experience with and that is Boba Teas.  Now keep in mind",I grew up in Houston which has a gigantic Asian community and I currently live in Chinatown Houston.  So my experience with Asian teas is pretty good.  There are only 2-3 that I love in the Houston area and the rest are mediocre or they just over sweeten their drinks.  So I order a Jasmine Milk Tea with Tapioca and their signature Strawberry Brick Toast.  The tea was served promptly while the toast took about 10 mins to prepare.  I took one sip of the tea and it was velvety smooth and sweetened just right!  I could taste the tea blend and jasmine without the sweet overpowering the whole thing but the best part?  The boba tapioca.  My goodness

There is nothing bad about this coffee shop let me put that out there first.  The only thing I would like to note is that their drinks are extremely inconsistent. Particularly now that they have tons of fresh faces serving you coffee instead of the familiar ones when they first opened. So expect the drinks to taste different every time you come.

Roscoe is the name of the 1952 Studebaker truck that is fully outfitted in the bed to serve numerous types of organic espresso drinks and teas.  I decided on the cold brewed iced coffee with organic whole milk and it was just about perfect - I prefer my brew stronger but that could have been my fault for adding too much milk. When asked how it was I mentioned that and Keturah (the proprietor) offered to add more Coffee which made it much better. The other creamer options are organic half and half and nonfat milk. My only suggestion would be invest in Stevia or at least Splenda instead of Sweet N Low for people who can not take sugar.  Bonus points for offering my dogs a bowl of water!!!

4859,The Buzz Mill,""" 7/24/2016 Some nice beer and a good sized venue.  All spoiled last night as bar staff unfairly cut off service to a large crowd of Deaf people enjoying a social night out. Apparently one or two had caused a problem",but for one bartender this meant all the Deaf people were in his words 'guilty by association' and around 80 people were forced to close out tabs and refused further service.  Other than the alleged incident - that seldom few in the garden area even knew had taken place - nobody else was even close to causing any kind of trouble; it had been a very chilled evening until this point and our experience was soured by this blatant act of discrimination. Many of my friends were left shell-shocked and any attempt to explain or placate the situation was shrugged off by the bartender

They made a huge deal about how she should be more specific and in the end refused to swap it out for her.    She's a sweet girl and non confrontational.

I get the impression that this joint probably rocks during the evening hours. The menu looks interesting but it was too early to order lunch. Was greeted by a friendly gentleman who took my order & payment for a 20 oz frappe. Asked for my name upon ordering but nobody called it when the drink was ready. When tilting the lidded cup towards me on my first sip I got a fat dribble of cold liquid down my front. Oh well. After a few minutes it occurred to me that the drink appeared small so I approached the counter with my cup to ask what size it was. The friendly fellow who overcharged me had been replaced by a young lady with a look on her face that seemed say """"dude why are you asking such a dumb question"""" while her mouth flatly said """"16"""" so I decided not to pursue the issue further. The drink was delicious but silly me for feeling intimidated. Came back a couple days later & it took a moment  to get any attention due the casual conversation ensuing behind the counter (different staff). Ordered another frappe with a breakfast taco which was tasty. But holy heck was that taco tiny for the price (see pic) and not even a """"thanks"""" for the tip jar deposit. Classy.

6239,Stinsonâs,""" 1/29/2015 I can honestly say this is the worst place I have ever continued to give multiple chances too and repeatedly speak on what is wrong with the quality of service as well as the product being produced here. I have spent over the last 7 months going in and out of Stinsons only to become more and more frustrated and disgusted each time. At first I went there as a customer who also works in the restaurant business and has done so for 12 + years and had compassion and understanding for those working I have spent hundreds of dollars in this place and regret every single one. The start of my disappointment happened when I Would come in and order a personal pizza and tip on top of that and not only did my co workers that also accompanied me quite frequently leave disappointed be rarely got our food in a time frame in which you can actually enjoy your lunch break. Working so close to this place has not only proven how inconsistent this place is but how those working lack character and concern for those who come in regularly and what their complaints are. Every time I walked into this place no one ever smiled or greeted you in the proper manner or even cared about giving good quality service. The next thing that disappointed me about this place was every time I ordered a pizza it was either burnt or not cooked enough and the kicker was the day I went to bite into my first slice and the entire bottom was covered in aluminum foil!!!! Yes ALUMINUM FOIL that I ate and chewed up and had to remove from my mouth! No one cared...I showed the girl working behind the counter and she just looked at me blankly....next I Start ordering the arugula salad adding cucumber and tomato .... I literally received this salad at one point with one cucumber and one tomato barely any arugula and specks of cheese....I was completely disappointed at how huge a difference you produce a salad being the only person making it one day to the next! Lastly this past Tuesday and last Friday I decided after not GOing for 2 months that I would try what they considered """"The best burger"""" ....which is a lie. Both times I pulled out the hair of the lady who made my burger and all the other food I ate there. She doesn't wear a net on her head and I see why I had to pull out 2 very long strands of hair twice....once was enough but twice on two separate very close in time occasions ...sickens me! I will never go back to this place because not one person working there cared when I showed them the hair. They again blankly stare at me in disbelief that I could continue to have such terrible experiences at their place of Work and still find no one to fix it. Over 7 Months of eating bland chicken salad sandwiches that taste like freezer burnt old chicken and sandwiches that are 10 dollars and don't even fill me up I can honestly say this place is the worst I have ever experienced on all levels in my life!

Then it was an additional 40 mins to get our food. We went on a Sunday at 11:00.... So maybe it was our fault for going in the prime time for brunch. The menu was a bit confusing.... They have a chalk menu I guess that had features or seasonal items. The actual menu was no where in sight. When I started in line I was by the door. There was no access to a menu until I got to the register to order. Maybe that's why there was such a wait because people didn't know what to order. The parking.... Where do people park? There is seriously like ten spots. The cleanliness there was kinda gross.... dust on the ceiling and on the tops of machines. The painted table tops where sticky (was it the paint or the syrup I dunno) The last thing that stop this from having five stars there was no children's menu. I get it not every place is a family place. After all who wants to give their small children coffee but something small like a sandwich or smaller pancake would be fine.

The peanut butter cookies were very dry and thumb print cookies have an odd after taste.  Not something I would buy again.

Your all natural ingredients don't work well together.  The butter may be something special but it leaves an odd after taste.  The place is grungy and in desperate need of a face lift and a good cleaning I don't care how weird you want to keep the place it should have a clean sense about it especially when serving food.  I consumed the purchase the day I purchased them so it wasn't like it sat around for a day or two.  In general everything I purchased was dry.

I can honestly say it is the one place I've found where I truly choose to seek out Gelato over ice cream.  It reminds me so much of what I ate internationally. So rich and creamy.

However due to the popularity comes an increase demand for seating. The idea behind gaming is I shouldn't hope I can get a seat if I choose to go there",it should basically be guaranteed. ET is driving away it's main audience by limiting the amount of seats there are. Imagine how this looks to other people trying to get into gaming. It's not very inviting.  - Limited food choices: In order to make money I understand there policy on no outside food or drink. However for the last 8 times I went they've been out of over half the sandwiches. How is this really viable for your business strategy? What they do end up having are sub-par pre-made sandwiches.

I think recently they have improved in the fact that they are apparently making their sandwiches in-house now. Before they were ordering them and toasting them on-site but always under-ordering for the weekend. Saturday and Sunday continually had them running out and the options for a place that doesn't allow outside grub were pretty slim. I get it. I know they don't have a full kitchen. I know there are limitations when you don't have a ventilation system. I don't know if they have a walk-in or how much space they can spare for food but we'll see how in-house sandwich prep goes.The minimal baked goods they have is sad though.

It's a super casual place that has a awesome patio that we will frequent once it cools down. They also have a super friendly staff. But the real reason you go to a place is because things taste good and service is good right... OK I'll get to it then.  I had the Persian Lamb sandwich and Lavender Lemonade. Hubs had the Bacon Havarti. All were big winners but the Lamb sammie was sooo great. My hubs is from Iceland where lamb is serious business and I wasn't expecting awesome but it really was just that- completely awesome. Fresh tomato and a flavorful sauce was on top (be warned it is messy but worth a good stain or two). The Lemonade was very sweet but it was a great twist with the lavender and wasn't overdone (it could have tasted like soap but instead it was just super refreshing).  Well done Mama!

7594,The Steeping Room,""" 2/17/2015 1 check-in This is my favorite tea place in Austin! Very vegan friendly. They always have a vegan soup","the tomato coconut bisque is super yummy! I absolutely crave the tempeh-bacon arugala & tomato tea sammie with balsalmic greens and a vegan currant scone. They also have some of the best chocolate cupcakes in town. :D """
7595,The Steeping Room,""" 1/9/2013 4 check-ins Listed in Vegan and the Beast I've been here several times with friends.  What? You haven't?!  Don't be ridick! You totes have to try the Steeping Room!  Get the vegan breakfast sandwich. It's sort of like a banh mi",but like all whited up.  You know
7596,The Steeping Room,""" 12/3/2015 I had the best experience at this restaurant!  Jordan was out waitress and she was so awesome.  I am doing a no sugar challenge and she went out of her way to make sure I was ordering food items without sugar!!!  So happy.  Great food","great service.  Definitely will be back! """
7597,The Steeping Room,""" 1/3/2014 1 check-in Listed in 2014 Yelp 100 Challenge HOLLA!!!!",SUGAR?!!! WHERE?!
7598,The Steeping Room,""" 4/13/2015 I went to the steeping room today for an early lunch. Every employee was super sweet and helpful. My server Shelby was great with helping me choose my tea. Went with the Jasmine Green tea which was so good I even got one to go when I left! For lunch I had the Vegan Tofu Tempeh Bacon Sandwich. It was the best tempeh bacon sandwich I have had! And I have tried quite a lot of them. Most places overdo the flavoring of tempeh and tofu but The Steeping Room really got it right. It was light and had the perfect amount of flavor and the side Cashew Ceasar salad was amazing too. I would have that salad for my entire meal.  I will definitely be recommending this place and becoming a regular. Although they probably don't need the recommendation because the restaurant was full by the time I left!  Great place for people with any dietary restrictions as well! They offer Gluten Free","Vegetarian and Vegan options. """
7599,The Steeping Room,""" 3/28/2015 1 check-in I am someone that hates going out for food bc a lot of times I feel like I could've made that better at home to my liking (and cheaper). Not the case here at all! I had an excellent experience here with a combination of the food and service and of course great company.  We sat in Jennifer's section (pretty sure that was her name",it's been two weeks) who only works at this (Lamar) location on Wednesdays. She was patient
7600,The Steeping Room,""" 5/10/2015 Great service with unimaginative and uneventful food that tastes frozen or pre-bought. I'd recommend the Steeping Room for a cup of tea but that would be about it.  Good: 1. Service was excellent. 2. The nora",spring rolls were quiet good. However
7601,The Steeping Room,2/22/2015 1 check-in Great selection of teas to purchase for home as well as a variety of both coffee & tea to brew while there. Highly recommend the chocolate chipotle chai! Chocolate chipotle chai,4.0 star rating
7602,The Steeping Room,""" 9/6/2015 2 check-ins I go here almost every week for my masala chai fix. The wait time for a table can range up to an hour or more on weekends",an online reservation is recommended around lunch time. On weekday nights
7603,The Steeping Room,""" 3/15/2014 1 check-in Went here for lunch today with Lauren H. and baby C. Called ahead and made a reservation",which I would advise doing as the place is small and we still had to wait a few minutes for our table. Once seated
7604,The Steeping Room,""" 10/25/2015 A few complaints about a wonderful little restaurant:  The TBLT (Turkey",Bacon
7605,The Steeping Room,""" 10/22/2015 I got the Chipotle Chocolate Chai tea and it was amazing. My tea sandwiches (pork) were so savory and I've never had fresher greens in my salad. The service was wonderful","all the servers and workers were so helpful and happy. It was a very peaceful atmosphere. I got some Jasmine Green Tea leaves to brew at home and am very happy with it. """
7606,The Steeping Room,6/11/2015 Same great tea and food as their Domain location but roomier and with closer and easier parking. I especially love their pine nut plum scones with jam or clotted cream. The one downside is the huge windowed front facing Lamar which is great on a cloudy but when sunny it fills the restaurant such that you have squint in almost any seat.,4.0 star rating
7607,The Steeping Room,8/14/2015 This place is amazing! It's one of my favorite Austin spots to hit! Everyone is totally great and on top of helping their customers. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice spot,5.0 star rating
7608,The Steeping Room,""" 9/20/2015 I come here when I visit my friend in Austin for a fun place with lots of yummy options. It gets 4 stars for having great food",but I will say I don't think it's all entirely fairly priced
7609,The Steeping Room,""" 12/7/2014 1 check-in After noticing many friends have come here and really enjoyed it",I decided to take a couple of out of town friends here for brunch.  It was definitely a great choice.  Having it been the first time here it was a little confusing between counter service and table service.  That said
7610,The Steeping Room,3/1/2016 Great food! I haven't had a meal I did not enjoy here. It's very clean and great for people with dietary restrictions.,5.0 star rating
7611,The Steeping Room,""" 2/19/2015 I actually step into this restaurant by chance and now is one of my favorites in Austin. I ordered Budha Bowl Java Bowl",Hummus and a couple of teas. I really liked Budha Bowl
7612,The Steeping Room,""" 1/21/2016 Ok",The Steeping Room IS awesome. How do they have so many great menu items. Of course they have LOTS of teas
7613,The Steeping Room,""" 4/30/2015 Loved coming here for tea",and the atmosphere was pretty and fresh. I ordered the strawberry herbal tea
7614,The Steeping Room,8/2/2015 The food is just average. The booths didn't feel very clean. The waitstaff was friendly and fairly efficient though.  I went with a tea enthusiast family member and they seemed impressed with the teas and things here. I probably wouldn't go back or recommend this place.,3.0 star rating
7615,The Steeping Room,5/23/2015 I finally stopped in for lunch with my colleague and I'm so glad we did. I had a delicious coconut milk soup and a chai tea. Yum!,4.0 star rating
